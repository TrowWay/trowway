Hi there I'm Trow, and I'm a Data Analyst. I really enjoy learning languages like Python and SQL to make analyzing data easier. I love to explore data to see what it has to say then create visualizations in Excel, PowerBI and Tableau to really bring it to life.

Skills: Python / SQL / Excel / PowerBI / Tableau
